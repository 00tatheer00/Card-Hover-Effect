                <h2>LONDON</h2>
                <p>London, a tapestry woven from ancient threads and shimmering modernity, pulsates with life. Big Ben's
                    stoic gaze watches over cobbled streets where double-decker buses dance, their red a splash against
                    the
                    grand stone facades. Beneath the watchful eyes of Westminster Abbey, the River Thames snakes its
                    way,
                    reflecting the kaleidoscope of cultures that call this city home.</p>
